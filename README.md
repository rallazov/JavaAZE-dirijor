**Vision:**  
Cutting-edge platform for safety & security of LLM agents and humans.  
One-click private network configurations across unlimited virtual instances on any private cloud (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Proxmox, etc.).  
Drag-and-drop canvas + orchestration + multi-agent consensus + verified semantic cache = zero hallucination, zero exposure.

**Quick Start**  
1. `git clone` this private repo  
2. `docker compose up` → your first 5-agent isolated realm spins in <60s  
3. Open http://localhost:3000 → live Network Canvas

Built to never let you hallucinate again.  
Ready for Phase 2 (full 12-cloud Terraform + live topology + marketplace).
